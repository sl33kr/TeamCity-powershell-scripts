These powershell scripts were written for use with the TeamCity powershell step, which could then be run in a meta runner. They were also originally stored and downloaded from Stash.
Each of the metarunner xml blocks makes the assumption that you have already put [TeamCityMetaRunnerScriptCmdLets](TeamCityMetaRunnerScriptCmdLets/) into your TeamCity instance.

They are in no way perfect so feel free to clone, fix and pull request or raise issues.

If I ever get around to it (you know kids, work and all that) I would like to turn these into Java TeamCity plugins or attempt to get some of the functionality included in NuGet.
